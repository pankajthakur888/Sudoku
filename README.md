## Overview

This repository contains a Flask-based Sudoku application with Docker support for containerization. This `README.md` provides instructions for setting up, using, and deploying the application.

## Git Basics

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the Project Directory

bash
Copy code
cd <repository-name>
Working with Git
Check the Status

bash
Copy code
git status
Add Changes

bash
Copy code
git add <file>  # Add a specific file
git add .       # Add all changes in the directory
Commit Changes

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Commit message"
Push Changes

bash
Copy code
git push origin <branch-name>
Pull Changes

bash
Copy code
git pull origin <branch-name>
Docker Deployment
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. Follow the Docker installation guide if necessary.

Dockerfile
The Dockerfile is used to build the Docker image for the application. Example:

dockerfile
Copy code
# Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
Creating requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file lists the Python packages your application needs. Example:

makefile
Copy code
Flask==2.2.2
requests==2.28.1
To generate requirements.txt from your current environment:

bash
Copy code
pip freeze > requirements.txt
Build and Run Docker Container
Build the Docker Image

bash
Copy code
docker build -t sudoku-app .
Run the Docker Container

bash
Copy code
docker run -d -p 80:80 sudoku-app
Docker Compose (Optional)
For multi-container setups, use Docker Compose. Example docker-compose.yml:

yaml
Copy code
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: sudoku-app
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
Start Services

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up
Stop Services

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
Application Usage
Run the Flask Application
If running without Docker, ensure you have all dependencies installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
Access the Application
Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.
